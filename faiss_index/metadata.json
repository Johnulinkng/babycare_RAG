If one partner is depressed the other partner is more likely to become depressed (\u2018Dual Depression\u2019) and it becomes more difficult to treat. Fathers who are depressed are less engaged with their children and have more relationship difficulties. Children of fathers who were depressed during or after pregnancy have an increased risk of developing behavioural and emotional difficulties in childhood and adolescence. We hope that treating mental illness in fathers will also improve the well-being of their children. New fathers are at risk of PPD if they have one or more of the following: \u2022 Personal history of Major Depressive Disorder \u2022 Wife has Postpartum Depression \u2022 Previous pregnancy loss \u2022 Relationship dissatisfaction \u2022 Job dissatisfaction/loss New fathers tend to cope",

    "chunk": "F A C T S H E E T Expressing and Storing Breast Milk Learning how to express breast milk is an important skill for mothers because it helps you to: \u2022 Get your baby interested in latching when you express a few drops before breastfeeding as your baby will smell and taste your milk. \u2022 Keep your nipples moist and prevent soreness by gently rubbing a few drops of breast milk onto your nipples. \u2022 Soften your breasts near your nipples before latching your baby, if your breasts are very full. \u2022 Collect and store your milk to feed your baby when you cannot be with him. \u2022 Increase your milk supply. Expressing Breast Milk You can practice expressing breast milk as soon as your baby is born or even before. In the first 2-3 days after birth, you will get a small amount of colostrum. Colostrum is rich in antibodies and nutrients. It is an excellent food for your newborn and gives your baby\u2019s immune system an important boost. Whether you are hand expressing or using a pump, it may take a few minutes for your milk to flow. At times, your milk will come faster, then slower, then faster again. This is normal. With practice, you will find out what works best for you. Reasons for Expressing Breast Milk You may need to express and store breast milk for different reasons: \u2022 If your baby is not able to breastfeed. \u2022 If your breasts are very full, hand expression before breastfeeding will soften",

Getting Ready When you are ready to express your milk, try to relax so that your milk will flow easily. Always wash your hands before expressing milk. You can try some or all of these things to see what works best for you: \u2022 Massage your breasts to help the milk to come down (this is the let-down reflex). There are different ways to do this. You can massage in a circular motion with your fingers together. Or, you can support your breast with one hand, and stroke the other side of your breast firmly with your other hand. Go from the chest towards the nipple, and work all around the breast. www.beststart.org F A C T S H E E T \u2022 Put a warm, wet cloth around your breasts, or have a shower to start the let-down reflex that helps your milk flow. \u2022 Choose a place where you are comfortable.

Do not squeeze the base of your nipple, as this will stop the flow of milk. \u2022 Move around your breast to express. Continue this until the flow of milk has slowed or stopped. You may want to switch hands now and again. \u2022 You can switch back and forth between breasts as often as you like. This can help milk flow.

Electric breast pump If you only need to pump for a few days or weeks you may decide to rent a hospital-grade electric breast pump. Hospital-grade electric breast pumps are also recommended if you are pumping for a baby with special needs such as a premature infant or a baby who is unable to breastfeed. You will need a kit to use with the double electric pump. Most facilities that rent or loan hospital-grade electric breast pumps have kits available to use with the pump. This pump allows you to pump both breasts at the same time. This is sometimes referred to as double pumping. Purchased electric breast pumps are not the same as hospital- grade electric breast pumps that can be used by more than one mother. Purchasing an electric breast pump may be a good choice if you have an established milk supply and plan to be pumping for some time.

Something so natural, it\u2019s not always easy, but you can learn, if you have the right resources, support and lots of patience. \u201d www.beststart.org F A C T S H E E T When you are using a pump, make sure your whole nipple area is centered inside the flange. Some breast pumps have flanges available in various sizes so that you can find one that that is right for you. Adjust the pump to its lowest setting, and increase the pressure as your milk starts to flow. Use as much pressure as is needed to keep your milk flowing. None of this should hurt. It is often best to pump both breasts at the same time. Double pumping is faster than pumping one breast at a time. You can pump each breast for 10-15 minutes. It is helpful to combine pumping with hand expression to increase your milk supply.

Expressing Milk When Your Baby Is Not Able to Breastfeed Begin with early and frequent hand expression and pumping. Try to start in the first hour after birth. You should express your milk 8 or more times in 24 hours, until your baby is breastfeeding effectively from your breasts. To ensure that you have a steady supply of milk, express regularly during the day and at least once during the night. Your milk production is greatest during the night. Expressing during the night helps you to make more milk. If your baby is sick or born prematurely, it may not be possible to breastfeed right away.

No car seat can guarantee protection from injury in every situation, but proper use helps reduce the risk of death or serious injury. If you have any questions or need assistance, please contact CYBEX at 1-877-242-5676 (USA and Canada). Also, please remember to register your Infant Car Seat so we can contact you in the unlikely event of a recall.

The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends keeping children REAR-FACING for as long as possible, until they reach the maximum height or weight for their Child Restraint in REAR-FACING orientation.* Additionally, some states\u2019 laws require children to be REAR-FACING until age 2. Accordingly, you will see this guidance reflected in the Child Requirements on the following pages. Please review any applicable local, state or provincial laws related to child passenger safety before installing and using this Child Restraint. 8 *Pediatrics. 2018;142(4):e20182460 Child Usage Guidelines Do not use this child restraint if your child does not meet all of these requirements: \u2022 Weight is between 1.8 and 15.8 kg (4 and 35 lbs) \u2022 Height is between 43 and 81 cm (17 and 32 in) \u2022 Top of child's head is a minimum of 2.5 cm (1 in) below the top of the Infant Carrier or headrest, WHICHEVER IS HIGHER.

Minimum 2.5 cm (1 in) 9 Child Usage Guidelines Premature Infant Use Before using this Child Restraint for preterm or low birth weight infants, ensure the Child Requirements are met and follow the guidelines in this section. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), a properly installed Child Restraint reduces the risk of death by over 70% for infants involved in crashes. Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) 213 establishes design and dynamic performance requirements for Child Restraint systems. However, the standard has no minimum weight limit and does not address the special medical needs of preterm or low birth weight infants. To ensure that preterm and low birth weight infants are transported safely, the guidelines published by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) in Pediatrics 2009;123:1424\u20131429 (reaffirmed June 2018) must be followed. Preterm and low birth weight infants are at additional risk of breathing difficulties and heart problems when placed in a Child Restraint. CYBEX requires that the evaluation recommended by the AAP be conducted for all infants born earlier than 37 weeks and all newborn infants who weigh less than 2.26 kg (5 lbs) at birth before their first car trip to check for breathing difficulties or heart rate problems when traveling in a REAR-FACING",

Newborn infants should NEVER travel in a FORWARD-FACING Child Restraint. 10 Child Usage Guidelines Premature Infant Use The AAP recommends that appropriate hospital staff observe your infant in the Child Restraint for a period of 90 to 120 minutes or the duration of travel, whichever is longer. This period of observation must be performed with the infant properly positioned as described in these instructions and with the Child Restraint placed at an angle that is approved for use in the vehicle. The hospital staff will check for any breathing difficulties or heart rate problems. Your child\u2019s pediatrician will let you know if there are any special considerations for travel. The number of trips and the duration of time the infant is seated in the Child Restraint should be minimized. A caregiver should ride in the back seat to monitor the infant during travel.

Breastfeeding Matters 1 S E C T I O N 1 The Importance of Breastfeeding Breastfeeding is important for you and your baby. The term breastfeeding/breast milk is also known as chestfeeding/chest milk and can be used interchangeably. Breast milk has over 200 known ingredients and is the healthiest food for your baby. It also protects your baby from infection and has special components to help your baby grow and develop. Your baby needs only breast milk for the first 6 months. At 6 months, start solid foods and continue to breastfeed for up to 2 years and beyond. Breastfeeding matters because: \u2022 Everyone benefits from breastfeeding: you, your baby, your family and your community. \u2022 Breast milk is convenient, always the right temperature and available anytime. \u2022 Breastfeeding is free. \u2022 Breastfeeding promotes bonding between you and your baby. \u2022 Breastfeeding is environmentally friendly. \u2022 Breastfeeding reduces health care costs for your family and society.

Your Breastfeeding Rights You have the right to breastfeed anywhere, anytime. This right is protected by the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. If you feel your breastfeeding rights are not being respected, report what happened to the Ontario Human Rights Commission at www.ohrc.on.ca/en/ pregnancy-and-breastfeeding-brochure. Groups such as La Leche League Canada and INFACT Canada may provide additional support. For more information about these groups, go to the Getting Help section on page 42 of this booklet.

The Baby-Friendly Initiative is an international strategy designed to support all families and babies. There are hospitals, public health units and other community health services that have received this designation or are working towards it. They apply high standards on how they support families by: \u2022 Supporting families to make an informed decision about feeding their babies. \u2022 Promoting practices that give parents and babies a healthy start. \u2022 Protecting families from the marketing pressures of formula companies and companies that make or distribute artificial nipples and bottles. Making an Informed Decision Most people know that breastfeeding is natural for babies and that breast milk is the healthiest milk for babies. However, sometimes parents decide to give their baby formula for a variety of reasons: \u2022 The baby has a medical condition and needs to be fed infant formula or a special formula. \u2022 The breastfeeding parent has a serious medical condition and is unable to breastfeed their baby. \u2022 The parent and baby are separated from one another and the parent is unable to express enough breast milk for their baby and the baby is not able to receive pasteurized breast milk from a human milk bank. \u2022 The family has chosen to feed infant",

Giving infant formula to a breastfed baby can decrease your breast milk supply. Supplementing with infant formula may lead to stopping breastfeeding before you had planned to stop. It can be hard to restart breastfeeding after stopping. Breastfeeding Matters 5 Here is a list of supplements in order of what to try first if available: 1. Your own fresh breast milk, hand expressed and/or pumped. 2. Your own breast milk that has been frozen and thawed just before using. 3. Pasteurized human milk (breast milk) from a human milk bank. In Canada, most milk banks only have enough milk for babies with special health needs (for example those in the NICU). 4. Commercial infant formula that is cow milk-based. If a baby needs to be supplemented after breastfeeding for a medical reason, your own expressed breast milk is the first option. For more information, go to page 13. It is also recommended to be aware of the potential risks of getting breast milk through the Internet or from individuals through the Internet or from individuals even if they are members of your family.

If you need to supplement your baby, there are many different ways to feed the supplement. Talk to a knowledgeable professional to see what might be best in your situation. Methods to supplement your baby are: \u2022 Open cup or spoon. \u2022 Lactation aid which uses a tube at your breast. \u2022 Finger feeder with a tube attached to your clean finger. \u2022 More specialized feeding device. \u2022 Bottle. If you are considering using infant formula, ask yourself: \u2022 Why did I decide to breastfeed? \u2022 Why am I considering feeding infant formula? \u2022 Have I considered the risks of not breastfeeding my baby? \u2022 Have I discussed my concerns with a health care provider who is knowledgeable and experienced with helping parents and babies with infant feeding? \u2022 What is the best decision for my baby, for me and for my family? \u2022 Do I think I will feel comfortable with my decision a month or two from now? 6 SECTION 1 \u2013 The Importance of Breastfeeding If you have more questions, have a conversation with your health care provider.

If you are thinking about using infant formula, or need to give infant formula: \u2022 Consider giving your baby as much breast milk as you are able. \u2022 Consider getting support to maintain your breast milk supply so you are able to offer some breast milk to your baby.

Patience and persistence is required but it is a wonderful bonding experience, one that I will cherish forever! Family and friends can help make breastfeeding a success in the following ways: \u2022 Become informed. Get information about breastfeeding before the baby is born. Discuss with friends, relatives, other breastfeeding families and health professionals to learn what makes the breastfeeding experience successful. Consider attending a prenatal breastfeeding course. Read this booklet. \u2022 Know where support is available. Become familiar with the resources in your community. Help the parent to access those supports.

Breastfeeding may seem challenging at times. There may be concerns for the breastfeeding parent or the baby. Encourage sharing concerns with someone knowledgeable about breastfeeding. Offer encouragement and share that you are there to help. \u2022 Do not disturb. Limit visitors, calls and other interruptions during the early weeks. This way the parent and baby can get to know one another and learn how to breastfeed. \u2022 Encourage rest. A parent needs lots of energy to focus on the baby, especially help with everyday needs such as meal preparation, dishes, laundry, keeping the home tidy and caring for other children. \u2022 Encourage the breastfeeding parent to focus on caring for oneself and feeding the baby. The breastfeeding parent and the baby should be together as this helps them learn about one another and develop a special breastfeeding relationship. \u2022 Have realistic expectations. A baby changes life. Parents need time to adjust to these changes. \u2022 Get help.

You may have friends or relatives who are breastfeeding their babies or who have recently breastfed. You can also meet other pregnant or breastfeeding parents through: \u2022 Prenatal classes. \u2022 Parenting groups. \u2022 Breastfeeding support networks. \u2022 La Leche League Canada groups. \u2022 Social media including local Facebook groups (be aware that there is potential for misinformation). For more information about breastfeeding support, go to page 42 of this booklet. I found my support from parents who are breastfeeding, my local public health nurses, my mother, some close friends, and my husband. But my greatest support was knowing that I was giving my little baby everything needed to grow healthy and strong, and to have a protected immune system.

Skin-to-Skin Skin-to-skin is a way of holding your baby that both babies and parents enjoy. Skin-to- skin is best done with the biological parent, especially at birth. Skin-to-skin is when your baby, wearing only a diaper, is placed against a parent\u2019s bare skin. When babies are held skin-to-skin, they can hear their parent\u2019s heart- beat and breathing, and smell and feel their skin. This is familiar and comforting, and helps them to use their natural instincts. The importance of skin-to-skin: \u2022 Helps your baby feel safe and secure. \u2022 Stabilizes your baby\u2019s heart rate, breathing and blood sugar. \u2022 Keeps your baby warm through your body heat. \u2022 Promotes bonding and getting to know your baby. \u2022 Helps your baby to be calm and cry less. \u2022 Helps you to be more confident and relaxed. \u2022 Helps decrease your baby\u2019s pain during medical procedures. \u2022 Helps your milk flow and may improve your milk supply. \u2022 Promotes a deep latch. This means that you are less likely to develop sore nipples and your baby will get more milk. Hold your baby skin-to-skin as soon as possible after giving birth. This special time will help both of you recover from the birth. Hold your baby without any interruptions, for an hour or more,",

As your baby grows, continue holding your baby skin-to-skin. Holding your baby skin-to-skin can help reduce discomfort during painful procedures such as the drawing of a blood sample or immunization. Being skin-to-skin also helps your baby relax and feel a special bond with you.

Hand Expressing Colostrum or Breast Milk Hand expression is using your hands to get colostrum and breast milk out of your breasts. Hand expression is an important skill for parents. Hand expressing colostrum or breast milk is important because it helps you to: \u2022 Express a few drops of colostrum or breast milk to get baby interested in latching. \u2022 Prevent soreness by gently rubbing a few drops of milk onto your nipples. \u2022 Soften your breasts near your nipples before latching your",

Colostrum is the first milk your body makes and is a rich, yellowish fluid. Colostrum is sometimes described as \u201cliquid gold\u201d because it is perfectly suited for your newborn baby. It is very nourishing, contains important immune boosting substances, and is easy for your baby to digest. To express colostrum or breast milk for your baby: \u2022 Wash your hands well. \u2022 Find a place where you are comfortable and relaxed. \u2022 If possible, hold your baby skin-to-skin before you start. \u2022 Gently stroke and massage your breasts moving from the chest wall toward the nipple.

Breastfeeding Matters 13 Sometimes a parent may not be able to breastfeed right away. If your baby is not taking milk directly from your breast, you can establish your milk supply by hand expressing, pumping, or a combination of both. It is important to establish and maintain your milk supply by removing milk as many times as a baby would feed, at least 8 or more times in 24 hours including through the night. You can even start in the first hour after birth, after your baby has been to your breast. If you need more information see the fact sheet Expressing and Storing Breast Milk that complements this resource at https://resources. beststart.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/B35-E.pdf. Responsive Cue-Based Feeding Breastfeed your baby often. Babies need to feed at least 8 or more times in 24 hours including through the night. Watch for your baby\u2019s cues and respond to them. Your baby will tell you when they are ready to feed, if they need a brief break during the feeding, and when they are finished feeding.

Your baby may change to fast sucks again later in the feeding. You will notice a pause during the suck when your baby\u2019s mouth opens the widest. \u2022 After your baby is four days old, your baby has at least three or four poopy diapers every 24 hours.

It is best to try to breastfeed your baby when they are showing early feeding cues as can be seen on page 14. In order to achieve an effective latch, consider the following: \u2022 You may need to support your breast with your hand (guiding hand). When using your fingers to cup your breast, make sure they are well back from the dark or pink area (areola) around your nipple. \u2022 Hold your baby tucked in close \u201ctummy-to-mommy\u201d, and preferably skin-to-skin without bundling your baby in a blanket (see page 11). \u2022 Support your baby with your hand behind your baby\u2019s shoulders, supporting the neck and not the head. Your baby\u2019s hands remain free to explore your breasts. \u2022 Your baby\u2019s nose approaches the nipple (nose-to-nipple as a landmark). Allow your baby to lick, search and explore the nipple. This will help trigger a wide open mouth. \u2022 Once your baby\u2019s mouth opens wide, place the bottom lip and chin below the nipple and gently push the areola into the mouth. Your nipple will be the last part in the mouth. When latched well, the chin will be pressed into your breast, your baby\u2019s head will be tipped back, and the tip of the nose may be touching your breast (not buried into the breast). 1 2 3 \u2022 You want your baby to have your nipple and part of your breast in",

How to Tell if Your Baby is Latched Deeply While your baby is breastfeeding you will know your baby is latched deeply if these things are happening: \u2022 Breastfeeding is comfortable for you. You feel a tugging sensation. This can sometimes be a little uncomfortable but you should not experience nipple pain. \u2022 Your baby\u2019s chin is tucked into your breast, your baby\u2019s head is titled slightly back, and your baby\u2019s nose is not indenting into the breast. \u2022 Your baby\u2019s mouth is wide open with the lips curled out. If your baby has a deep latch you might not see your baby\u2019s lower lip. \u2022 Your baby has a strong, slow, regular suck. Your baby\u2019s cheeks remain full and rounded, not dimpling or indrawn. \u2022 You can hear swallowing (\u201ckah\u201d sounds). \u2022 Your baby\u2019s ears or temple are moving while your baby sucks. \u2022 Your baby is comfortable and maintains the latch. When your baby is finished breastfeeding: \u2022 Your nipples will have a normal, rounded shape and they should not look pinched. \u2022 Your breasts feel softer.

If your baby does this, it is a sign that your baby needs a little more. If your baby fusses and doesn\u2019t latch, try these things: \u2022 Move your baby back to an upright position between your breasts. \u2022 Stroke and talk to your baby until your baby calms down. \u2022 Calm yourself. This will help calm your baby too. \u2022 Switch to a different breastfeeding position. \u2022 See if your baby will latch by themself in the laid-back position.

When your baby is positioned comfortably and aligned with your breast, a deep and effective latch is more likely and can: \u2022 Help your baby suck effectively. \u2022 Help your baby get enough milk. \u2022 Stimulate, build and maintain your breast milk production. \u2022 Help prevent many breastfeeding problems such as sore nipples, mastitis, low breast milk supply, and poor weight gain.

Lying down When you are tired (and all new parents are tired!) it helps to be able to breastfeed lying down. \u2022 Lie on your side, with a pillow under your head. Some parents like a pillow behind their back or one between their knees, too. \u2022 Let the pillow support the weight of your head. \u2022 Have your baby on their side with their entire body facing you. \u2022 Bring your baby close to you but positioned far enough away from your breast so their head tips back to reach up to your nipple. \u2022 When your baby opens their mouth wide, bring your baby close so that your baby\u2019s chin presses against your breast. \u2022 You may want to change both you and your baby\u2019s position to feed from your other breast.

Your baby will lift up their head, push with their legs, and use their hands to help find the nipple. At first, your baby might just lick the nipple or might bob their head up and down over the breast. After a while your baby will find the nipple and latch. \u2022 If your nipple feels sore as your baby sucks or you are not comfortable, you can move your baby a little until it feels better.

Breastfeeding Matters 21 Signs that Breastfeeding is Going Well How often should I breastfeed and for how long? Most newborn babies feed 8 or more times in 24 hours. Breastfeeding provides the food your baby needs to grow and develop. Some babies feed regularly and establish a routine quickly, others like to have short feeds very often especially in the evening or at night. This is called cluster feeding. It is very common in the first few weeks. Respond to your baby whenever they show feeding cues. Breastfeed your baby as long as your baby wants to feed. When your baby stops feeding on the first breast, burp your baby and offer the second breast. This will ensure you have a plentiful milk supply as your baby grows. Some babies feed for 20 minutes, others take much longer. Your baby may also feed longer at some feedings and take less time at other feedings. You do not need to time the feed or worry about them as long as your baby: \u2022 Feeds often, at least 8 or more times in 24 hours, during the daytime",

It is normal for your baby to lose weight in the first few days after birth (refer to the chart on page 25). Remember, watch your baby, not the clock. As babies get older they may change how long or how often they feed. Follow your baby\u2019s cues. Your baby knows when they are hungry and when they are full. Whenever your baby wants to feed, start with the fullest breast. This is usually the breast your baby finished on their last feed. If your baby last fed on only one breast, start with the other breast. Let your baby feed as long as they are interested. Switch to the other breast: \u2022 Once the first breast feels softer. \u2022 Your baby is no longer sucking actively. \u2022 Your baby lets go of your breast or falls asleep.

This can be especially helpful in the early days or weeks. 22 Section 3 \u2013 Learning to Breastfeed Some babies release the breast when they are finished, others don\u2019t. If your baby has been pausing a lot and is no longer swallowing, take them off your breast. Slip a clean finger between your breast and your baby\u2019s gums to break the suction. Some babies always feed from both breasts, others don\u2019t. Some babies have a short nap and then want to feed from the other breast. Change the breast you start on at each feeding. Sometimes you know which side is fuller. Some breastfeeding parents keep track by putting a ribbon on their bra or a bracelet on their arm. Do whatever works for you and your baby. Breast Compressions Some newborn babies fall asleep easily while they are feeding. To encourage your baby to keep feeding until they are full, you can use breast compressions.

To do breast compressions, follow these steps: \u2022 Hold your breast with your fingers on one side, thumb on the other, away from the areola. See illustration below. \u2022 Compress the breast (firm but gentle squeeze) when your baby\u2019s sucking slows down. \u2022 Release the compression when your baby pauses or stops sucking. \u2022 See if your baby swallows more when you compress your breast between sucks or with a suck. This will help your baby to get more milk. \u2022 Continue with breast compressions until your baby is no longer sucking. \u2022 Watch your baby\u2019s sucking pattern. \u2022 Offer the other breast as needed.

These are signs that your baby is getting enough milk (refer to chart below): \u2022 Your baby feeds at least 8 times every 24 hours. \u2022 Your baby has enough wet and dirty diapers according to their age (see chart on page 25). \u2022 Your baby is active and has a strong cry. \u2022 Your baby has a wet, pink mouth, and bright eyes. To make sure your baby is getting enough milk, keep track of the number of wet and dirty diapers in a 24 hour period. In the beginning it can be hard for new parents to know if their baby has a wet diaper. A very wet diaper is heavier than a dry diaper. If you want to know what a very wet diaper feels like, pour 45 ml (3 tablespoons) of water on a dry diaper. Your baby\u2019s urine (pee) should be clear or pale yellow, and it should have no smell. If a dirty diaper is heavy, count it as both a wet diaper and poopy diaper. If your baby does not have enough wet and dirty diapers, get help right",

Weight is just one part of a larger picture of how a baby is doing. During the first 3-4 months, your baby\u2019s health care provider will check their growth regularly. If your baby is gaining more slowly, be sure you are responding quickly to early feeding cues and rousing your baby to feed if necessary. You can also use breast compressions and have your baby feed from both breasts more than once (switch nursing). After a feeding you can express some milk and feed the milk to your baby using a spoon, dropper or small cup. Be sure to get help from your health care provider and have them watch a feeding so they can see your baby feeding. 24 Section 3 \u2013 Learning to Breastfeed After baby is 2 days old expect your breastfed baby to have 3 or more large, soft, usually seedy poops per day.

Tips to wake and feed a sleepy baby: \u2022 Keep your baby close so you notice when they show early feeding cues. Babies can feed even when they are drowsy or not fully awake. It is best to feed when your baby shows early feeding cues. \u2022 Feed your baby as soon as they show early feeding cues, or your baby may go back into a deeper sleep. To learn about feeding cues go to page 14 of this booklet. \u2022 Hold your baby skin-to-skin. Your baby will breastfeed more often if kept skin-to-skin on your chest while you are awake. \u2022 Unwrap and undress your baby. Change the diaper if it is wet or dirty. \u2022 Lift your baby to your shoulder and gently rub their back and body. \u2022 Roll your baby gently from side to side.

Breastfeeding Matters 27 Calming a Fussy Baby Babies cry for many reasons \u2013 discomfort, loneliness, hunger, fear, tension, or tiredness. Some babies cry more than others even when they are healthy and well fed. This happens more often in the first three months. It also happens more at night. You cannot spoil your baby by holding and comforting them. In fact, babies develop best when their parents respond quickly to their needs and cues. If you know your baby has been well fed and burped, and your baby seems to cry for no reason, try these suggestions: \u2022 Hold your baby in your arms. \u2022 Hold your baby skin-to-skin (see page 11 for more information on how to safely hold your baby skin-to-skin). \u2022 Speak or sing to your baby. \u2022 Walk, rock or sway with your baby. Babies become familiar with their parent\u2019s heartbeat, voice and movements in the months before birth and this can be calming. \u2022 Change your baby\u2019s diaper if it is wet or dirty. \u2022 Adjust your baby\u2019s clothes if they seem too warm",

Use breast compressions and offer the first and second breast again. Use calming strategies to calm yourself, such as counting slowly to ten, breathing deeply, or pretending you are blowing bubbles. These strategies will often calm your baby too. If you are getting frustrated or the above suggestions are not working, ask your partner or a trusted adult to hold your baby while you take a break. If there is no one to help you, place your baby in a safe place such as the crib, and have a short break.

It is still a good idea to try to burp your baby. Some babies fuss if they need to burp.

Using a Pacifier (Soother) Many breastfed babies never use a pacifier. When a baby is fussy, offer the breast first. See page 28 for information about soothing a fussy baby. It is important to make an informed decision if you are thinking about offering a pacifier to your baby. Offering a pacifier to delay a feeding can result in your baby not getting enough breast milk and slow weight gain patterns. This can also lead to a reduction in your milk supply. There is limited research that suggests pacifier use can increase the risk of your baby getting an ear infection. Babies who use pacifiers over the long term may develop dental problems. There are also safety considerations with the pacifier itself such as cleanliness and the pacifier not having any damage.

The amount of milk you make is directly related to the amount of milk that is removed from your breasts when your baby breastfeeds, or when you express breast milk by hand or with a breast pump. I\u2019ve had breast surgery. Can I breastfeed? Being able to produce enough milk following breast surgery depends on several factors: \u2022 The kind of surgery you had. \u2022 The way the surgery was done. \u2022 Whether there was damage to nerves and ducts. \u2022 The length of time since the surgery was done. It is impossible to predict what success a parent will have with breastfeeding after breast surgery. The only way to know for sure is to try. It may take longer than usual to build your milk supply. Your baby should be seen by a health care provider regularly in the first few weeks. If possible work with a International Board Certified Lactation Consultant. It\u2019s best to start working with a lactation consultant before your baby is born. This will help you make a breastfeeding plan including when to follow-up with the lactation consultant and other health care providers. My nipples are flat or inverted. Can I breastfeed?

If you and your baby are having problems, get help right away. Go to section Getting Help on page 42 in this booklet. What if I don\u2019t have enough breast milk? Most parents have more than enough breast milk for their babies. Here are some things you can do to make sure you have plenty of breast milk for your baby. \u2022 Start breastfeeding as soon as possible after your baby is born. \u2022 Breastfeed your baby often, at least 8 or more times in 24 hours (day and night). \u2022 Hold your baby skin-to-skin as much as possible. \u2022 Offer your breast whenever your baby is fussy or shows feeding cues. \u2022 If you have concerns, hand express after each feeding and offer your milk to your baby with a small cup or spoon. Talk with your health care provider about other ways to feed expressed breast milk. If you are concerned, get help. Go to the section called Getting Help on page 42 of this booklet.

Breastfeeding Matters 33 Why does my baby gulp, choke and fuss or come off my breast right after I start nursing? Sometimes the milk comes a little too fast for a baby. This is called over-active milk ejection reflex (let-down). It may cause your baby to be gassy, spit up or have watery stools. It is most common in the first 6 weeks of breastfeeding. Here are some things you can do: \u2022 Breastfeed immediately when your baby shows early feeding cues such as baby licking lips, opening and closing mouth and sucking on fingers or hands. Your baby will suck more gently if you feed when you notice early signs of hunger rather than waiting for later feeding cues. \u2022 Lie down or lean back while feeding so your milk will be flowing up to the baby. \u2022 Stop and burp your baby whenever your baby gulps, coughs, or chokes. \u2022 Feed your baby from both breasts at each feeding. \u2022 Some parents find it helpful to hand express some breast milk before they begin breastfeeding. This means your baby starts feeding when the fastest flow of milk is over. It is best to do this only when your breasts feel very full and not at every feeding because it encourages your breasts to produce more milk than your baby needs. Can I breastfeed more than one child at a time? Yes you can breastfeed twins and other multiples. Also,",

Yes you can breastfeed twins and other multiples. Also, you can breastfeed while pregnant, and you can breastfeed an older and younger child. The milk will be designed for the younger child and will be healthy for the older child. The younger child needs priority for the milk, and will almost always feed more often. Breasts usually adapt to produce all the milk needed. Refer to the resource Breastfeeding Protocol: Positioning and Latching pages 16 to18 at https://breastfeedingresourcesontario. ca/sites/default/files/pdf/BFI_Positioning_and_Latching_web3.pdf.

If you have pain, swelling or redness in your breast and have a fever, you may have a breast infection, also called mastitis. It is okay to continue breastfeeding from both breasts. It is important to breastfeed or express milk from the breast that is infected every 2-3 hours, or the infection may get worse. The breast milk is safe for your baby and has antibodies to help protect your baby from infection. Contact your health care provider to get treatment. For more information see the fact sheet Breast Infection (Mastitis) that complements this resource at https://resources.beststart.org/ wp-content/uploads/2018/12/B34-E.pdf. I noticed a lump in my breast. What is it? If you notice a lump in your breast that does not go away with breastfeeding, it is most likely a blocked milk duct. Continue to breastfeed your baby. Tell your health care provider if you have a lump in your breast that does not go away.

Milk supply usually settles down in a few weeks. Some parents continue to have an over-abundant milk supply. This may be natural for your body or it may be caused by expressing milk regularly as well as feeding your baby. If you are expressing your breast milk, decrease the number of times you are expressing your milk gradually until you are no longer expressing more than your baby needs. If your milk supply is over-abundant without expressing, try the tips on the top of page 34. Once your baby starts solids, you can use the milk stored in your freezer to mix with the solids. If you want to provide your milk for sick or premature babies, contact a human milk bank. In Ontario go to https://www.milkbankontario.ca/. Breastfeeding Matters 35 How will I know if my baby or I have thrush? Sometimes a breastfeeding parent and their baby will develop thrush. Thrush is a fungal infection that can develop on your nipples and also in your baby\u2019s mouth. There may be many symptoms. Your nipples may be sore and itchy. Your baby\u2019s mouth may have white patches. If you think you and/or your baby may have thrush, contact your health care provider.

Do I have less milk? The amount of milk in your breasts is not related to how your breasts feel. Your breasts change over time and adapt to your growing baby. Usually, having an older baby means having softer breasts. I heard that breastfeeding can help lessen my baby\u2019s discomfort during blood draws and vaccinations. Is this true? Yes, breastfeeding while your baby is having blood drawn or during an injection will help to reduce pain and distress. Inform your health care provider that you wish to breastfeed while they perform the blood draw or injection. Ask your health care provider to begin once your baby is sucking well. Continue breastfeeding for a few minutes after the health care provider is finished. The combination of breastfeeding with your touch and gentle words is one of the best ways to reduce pain for your baby. When will my baby sleep through the night? Every baby is different and babies need to feed around the clock (even overnight), especially in the early days. This meets your baby\u2019s needs because of their small tummy and helps you by stimulating your breasts frequently. Feed your baby in response to your baby\u2019s hunger cues, even during the night.

For more information refer to the section Mental Health at https:// resources.beststart.org/product-category/ resources/mental-health/. Can I breastfeed when I am sick? Even when you are sick, you can usually still breastfeed your baby. If you have a cold, flu or another type of infection, your body will make antibodies to fight the illness. You will pass these antibodies to your baby through your breast milk. This will give your baby some protection against your illness. When you are sick, it is always best to ask your health care provider if there are any precautions you should take. What should I eat when I am breastfeeding? Go ahead and eat all of your favourite healthy foods. Even if you do not have a perfect diet, your milk will still have the nourishment your baby needs.

Alcohol is transferred to your baby through breast milk. Alcohol decreases the letdown reflex and this could result in your baby getting less breast milk during feedings. Heavy drinking while breastfeeding has been shown to increase your baby\u2019s risk of poor weight gain, poor growth, and possible developmental delays. If you choose to have an occasional alcoholic drink while breastfeeding, it is important to plan ahead and drink alcohol immediately after breastfeeding, not before breastfeeding. Many parents choose an alcohol-free drink instead. For more information see Mixing Alcohol and Breastfeeding at https://resources.beststart.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/A21-E-1.pdf or discuss with your health care provider. Breastfeeding Matters 37 Is it safe to take medication while I am breastfeeding? Most medications are safe when you are breastfeeding, but always check with your health care provider or your pharmacist. Speak to your health care provider about breastfeeding if you use street drugs. Street drugs can harm your baby. Let your health care provider know that you are breastfeeding if they are prescribing medications.

Is it safe to use cannabis while I am breastfeeding? When a breastfeeding person uses cannabis, a chemical called THC passes into the breast milk and is taken into a baby\u2019s fat cells and brain. It can be stored there for weeks. Some research shows that babies exposed to THC through breast milk have slower motor developments (affects baby\u2019s movements and responses). It is best to stop using cannabis while breastfeeding until further information about the effects of cannabis on babies are available. If you are unable to stop using cannabis, try using less and talk to your health care provider.

When should I feed my baby more than breast milk? Breastfeed your baby and give vitamin D drops for the first 6 months. Watch your baby for signs of readiness to begin other foods around 6 months of age. Babies who are ready to begin complementary foods are able to: \u2022 Hold their head up steadily. \u2022 Sit up and lean forward. \u2022 Open their mouth when food is offered. \u2022 Use their thumb and their finger to pick up food. \u2022 Let you know when they are full and they no longer want food. Talk to your health care provider or a skilled professional such as a registered dietitian or public health nurse if you are thinking of beginning solids a little earlier or later than when your baby is 6 months old. Continue to breastfeed up to age of 2 years and beyond. Breastfeeding and breast milk provide your baby with important nutrients and immune protection even when your baby is receiving other foods as well.

Many breastfeeding parents worry that once their baby has teeth, they will bite or chew on the nipple. When babies are actively sucking while breastfeeding, they do not bite. If your baby bites when pausing or resting at the breast, your natural reaction will be to pull away or take your baby off the breast by breaking the seal. This will often discourage further biting.

You need help from a health care provider if: \u2022 Your nipples or breasts hurt. \u2022 You have a fever or feel sick. \u2022 Your baby reaches 4 days of age and is having fewer than 6 very wet diapers or is having fewer than 3 poopy diapers in 24 hours \u2022 Your baby is having black poops after they are 4 days old. \u2022 Your baby is very sleepy and always has to be woken up to eat. \u2022 You are thinking about weaning. \u2022 You are feeling worried about breastfeeding. \u2022 You are worried about yourself or your baby for any reason. Where to Get Help? Professional help can include physicians, midwives, nurse practitioners, International Board Certified Lactation Consultants, and nurses. Parent-to-parent or peer supports can also help to build your confidence with breastfeeding and can be a source of information and support.

Breastfeeding Matters 43 I am extremely grateful for this booklet and groups that support breastfeeding. When my baby was first born I was lost and an emotional wreck. I was overwhelmed at all the support my region offered. The other parents in the support groups were amazing! Telling each of our stories, successes and struggles allowed me to leave there with confidence in my decision to keep breastfeeding. These groups and booklets are really important. www.healthnexus.ca | www.beststart.org The views expressed in this publication are the views of the Recipient and do not necessarily reflect those of the Province.

Learn the cues that mean your infant is tired, e.g., yawns, losing interest, quiet, whines more, rubs his eyes, etc. \u2022 Aim for a flexible feeding and sleeping routine based on the needs of your infant. \u2022 Feed your infant whenever he shows feeding cues. Most newborn babies feed at least 8 times in 24 hours. Some babies feed regularly and establish a routine quickly, others like to have short feeds very often especially in the evening or at night.

Familiarize him to common sounds and noises. \u2022 Establish a brief routine before bedtime and nap time. Your infant will learn to associate the bedtime and nap routine with going to sleep. Choose a couple of activities like breastfeeding, bathing, telling a story, singing or massaging, etc. The routine should be enjoyable to all. \u2022 Keep your infant\u2019s sleeping area comfortable with dim light and appropriate temperature. \u2022 Keep night time quiet.

It is important to always supervise your infant. Tummy Time \u2022 Avoid long periods in sitting positions like in the car seat, a stroller, a bouncer, etc. When your infant is awake give her lots of cuddle time. \u2022 Each day switch the end of the crib where you place your infant\u2019s head. Your infant will naturally turn her head towards the door so she can see you coming. It is not necessary to change her head position when she is sleeping. No positioning aids, like blanket rolls or positional devices should be used. \u2022 Consult your health care provider if your infant develops plagiocephaly. 8. | When my infant rolls over do I need to reposition her on her back? \u2022 As infants get older they are usually able to turn over onto their tummy by",

Why does it seem to work? \u2022 If you use white noise every time your infant falls asleep he will begin to recognize it as part of the routine that signals that bedtime is approaching. It will then be more difficult to get him to sleep in situations where you can\u2019t provide him with white noise. \u2022 White noise can be used as a tool when nothing else seems to be settling your infant. \u2022 White noise may work at times to diminish the distraction of other surrounding noises and for some infants white noise can be comforting. \u2022 Some white noise machines can produce sound at a level that is damaging to hearing.

The Public Health Agency of Canada, the Dietitians of Canada, the Canadian Paediatric Society and the College of Family Physicians of Canada agree: 4 q Babies need only breast milk for the first 6 months. 4 q At 6 months, babies begin to eat solid foods and continue to breastfeed for up to 2 years and beyond. Is it OK to have a few drinks at a special event? 4 q The safest choice is not to drink alcohol if you are planning to become pregnant, are pregnant, or are breastfeeding. Choose an alcohol-free drink instead. What effect can breast milk containing alcohol have on a baby? 4 q Babies may not like breast milk containing alcohol. The baby could drink less milk. 4 q The younger the baby, the more immature his/her system, and the greater the difficulty in clearing the alcohol from his/her body. Limit alcohol intake, particularly when breastfeeding newborns (first 3 months). 4 q Mothers who drink heavily while breastfeeding put their baby at risk for poor weight gain, poor growth, and possible developmental delays. What does alcohol do to the milk supply? 4 q Alcohol decreases the letdown reflex and this could mean the baby gets less breast milk during feedings. 4 q Drinking alcohol does not increase milk production.

Follow them carefully and keep them with the car seat. You will need them as your baby grows. (cid:84) Is your infant facing the right way for both weight and age? TIP * It is safer for infants to ride rear-facing as long as possible, until they reach the rear-facing weight of their Convertible or 3-Stage seat or the top of the head is 2.5 cm (1 in.) below the top of the seat. Convertible and 3-Stage seats can be used rear-facing until 13.6-20 kg (30-45 lb.), depending on the model. * The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that infants rear-face until age 2. * It is O.K. for the infant\u2019s feet to touch the vehicle seat back. (cid:84) Have you checked your vehicle owner\u2019s manual? TIP * Your vehicle owner\u2019s manual has information about air bags, seat belts or Universal Anchorage System (UAS) and tether anchors. * Do not install the car seat in a front seating position that has an active air bag. * Children 12 and under are safer in the back seat. * For side-impact air bags in the back seat, follow the vehicle manufacturer\u2019s instructions.

TIP * Thread the seat belt or UAS belt through your car seat\u2019s rear-facing belt path. When tightening the belt, push the seat down and into the upholstery. * The car seat should not move more than 2.5 cm (1 in.) toward the front of the vehicle or side-to-side where the belt is attached. * For a rear-facing car seat, it is normal to be able to lift the seat toward the rear of the vehicle. Also, it is O.K. for the top part of the seat to shift from side-to-side, as long as the car seat is attached securely where the belt is attached. (cid:84) Is the infant seat at the correct angle? TIP * When rear-facing, an infant car seat should be at a 45 degree angle. This stops your * infant\u2019s head from flopping forward. Some infant seats have built-in recline indicators. If your infant sits too upright, try adjusting the base, or placing a rolled towel or foam noddle in the vehicle seat crack, under the infant seat, to get the correct the angle.

Cesarean births are done if a vaginal birth is impossible or unsafe for you or your baby. Unplanned Cesareans Unplanned cesareans are done when they become necessary during labor. The cesarean incision is just above the pubic hair Reasons for unplanned cesareans: \u2022 Cephalopelvic disproportion (CPD), a rare condition in which the baby\u2019s head does not fit through the pelvis (it is common for labor to slow down, and pushing efforts may be long and ineffective) \u2022 Abnormal fetal heart rate \u2022 Labor is not progressing despite augmentation efforts \u2022 The baby moves into a position that makes vaginal birth difficult or impossible Emergency Cesareans Emergency cesareans are rare and may be done at any point during labor.

If an emergency situation occurs, general anesthesia may be given because it takes effect quickly. Using an existing epidural or rapid spinal block as pain relief during surgery is sometimes possible. Reasons for emergency cesareans: \u2022 A placental abruption, which is when the placenta separates from the uterus wall before the baby is born. This can cause severe bleeding. \u2022 Cord prolapse, which is when the baby\u2019s head is still high and the umbilical cord slips through the dilated cervix. The cord can get pinched by the baby\u2019s head as it descends. A pinched cord blocks the flow of oxygen to the baby. \u2022 Uterine rupture, which is a tear in the wall of the uterus that can cause dangerous bleeding and fetal distress. \u2022 If your baby has a major drop or rise in their heart rate or has a flat heart rate that cannot be resolved by your healthcare providers.

Some dogs and cats will have a different time adjusting to these changes, especially if this is your first child, but preparation and planning will help. How is my pet likely to respond to the new arrival? This will depend a lot on the pet\u2019s previous experience with children. Here are some things to consider: \u2022 If there has been previous aggression or fear with children, it may be necessary to consult with a veterinary behaviourist \u2022 If there has been little or no exposure to young children or babies, there may be some initial anxiety or associated with the sights, sounds, and odors of the new child. \u2022 Keeping all introductions positive will help get the relationship between your pet and your new child off to a good start. \u2022 As your child learns to roll, crawl, and walk, some pets may have trouble adapting to one or more of these changes. Fear, dominance challenges, possessive displays, and playful behaviors could result in aggression. Anxiety or fear could lead to anorexia, compulsive disorders or destructiveness. What can we do to prepare for the new arrival? Behavior problems may not develop directly from the arrival of the child, but rather from the changes in the household, associated with the new arrival. \u2022 Consider any changes that you may need to make",
